# Rock Paper Scissors – Python Game 🎮🪨📄✂️

A simple Rock–Paper–Scissors game written in Python.  
This project helped me practice:

- User input handling  
- Using lists  
- Random module  
- Game logic and conditions  
- Basic scoring system  

## 🧠 How it works
- User selects Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2)  
- Computer generates a random move  
- Game compares both choices  
- Scoreboard displays:
  - Wins
  - Losses
  - Draws  

## ▶️ Run the game
```bash
python rps_game.py
```

## 🚀 Learning Journey
I built this as part of my Python learning path toward Cybersecurity.  
More projects coming soon!
